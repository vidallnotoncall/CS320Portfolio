In order to ensure my code is funtional and secure I write preventative measures at the beggining of
every function to ensure that the code cant crash by the code trying to do things it wasnt programmed
to do. This is tied directly to incorporating user needs into every program created. The needs of the user
often require that more than one or two functions to work together. This involves properly breaking down
each need into smaller parts each represented by a piece of code. Once these have been created its 
neccessary to create a way to test each of these functions and pieces of code to ensire they not only work
together but on also satisfy the user requirements
